# BrokenImagePickers

A quick project to show some errors I've come up against using the UIImagePickerController and PHPickerViewController.

I don't seem to be able to get them working properly with SwiftUI.

They work fine if you just select a photo but when you enter the search bar (sometimes you have to scroll a bit after entering the serahc bar) it will crash.

UIImagePickerController will just crash out completely.

PHPickerViewController will display a message "Unable to Load Photos".

If you have any ways to fix the errors then please let me know.

Feel free to open a pull request.

N.B. I tried to take a screen recording of this happening but it seems that this bug does not manifest itself when taking a screen recording.
