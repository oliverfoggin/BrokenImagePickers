# BrokenImagePickers

A quick project to show some errors I've come up against using the UIImagePickerViewController and PHPickerViewCOntroller.

I don't seem to be able to get them working properly with SwiftUI.

If you have any ways to fix the errors then please let me know.

Feel free to open a pull request.

Thanks
